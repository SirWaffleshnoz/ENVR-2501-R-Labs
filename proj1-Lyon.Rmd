### Problem 1
## 1.
```{r}
# Probability of detecting swine flu given that it was contracted
pD.F2 <- 0.7
# False detection rate
pD.opF2 <- 0.1
# Swine flu prevalence
pF2 <- 0.6
# Calculate probability of detection
pD <- (pD.F2 * pF2) + (pD.opF2 * (1 - pF2))

# Calculate the probability of having the swine flu, given detection
pF2.D <- (pD.F2 * pF2)/pD
pF2.D
```
The probability of having the swine flu given detection is 0.9130

## 2.
```{r}
plot(pisco$latitude, pisco$chla, xlab="Latitude", ylab="[chl-a]")
```

There appears to be a clear latitudinal trend in primary production ([chl-a]) along the West Coast of the US, with chl-a increasing with latitude.
