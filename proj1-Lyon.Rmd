### Problem 1
## 1.
```{r}
# Probability of detecting swine flu given that it was contracted
p.D.F2 <- 0.7
# False detection rate
p.D.opF2 <- 0.1
# Swine flu prevalence
p.F2 <- 0.6
# Calculate probability of detection
p.D <- (p.D.F2 * p.F2) + (p.D.opF2 * (1 - p.F2))

# Calculate the probability of having the swine flu, given detection
p.F2.D <- (p.D.F2 * p.F2)/p.D
p.F2.D
```
The probability of having the swine flu given detection is 0.9130

## 2.
```{r}
p.D.F2 <- 0.7
# Assign four equally spaced prevalance values
p.F2 <- seq(from = 0.2, to = 0.8, by = ((0.8 - 0.2)/3))
# Assign 100 equally spaced false detection rates
p.D.opF2 <- seq(from = 0.01, to = 0.5, by = ((0.5 - 0.01)/99))
# Create matrix
p.F2.D <- matrix(nrow = length(p.F2), ncol = length(p.D.opF2))

# Nested loop to fill matrix
for (i in 1:NROW(p.F2.D)) {
  for (j in 1:NCOL(p.F2.D)) {
    # Calculate probability of having the flu given detection at each point in the above sequences
    p.F2.D[i, j] <- ((p.D.F2 * p.F2[i])/((p.D.F2 * p.F2[i]) + (p.D.opF2[j] * (1 - p.F2[i]))))
  }
}
p.F2.D
```

## 3.
```{r}
# Plot the matrix generated in question 2
# Plot the first row of p.F2.D
plot(p.D.opF2, p.F2.D[1, ], xlab = "False Detection Rate", ylab = "Probability of Having the Flu Given Detection", col = "red", abline(b = 0, a = 0.5, lty = "dotted"))
# Plot the second row of p.F2.D
par(new = TRUE)
plot(p.D.opF2, p.F2.D[2, ], xlab = "False Detection Rate", ylab = "Probability of Having the Flu Given Detection", col = "blue", axes = F)
# Plot the third row of p.F2.D
par(new = TRUE)
plot(p.D.opF2, p.F2.D[3, ], xlab = "False Detection Rate", ylab = "Probability of Having the Flu Given Detection", col = "green", axes = F)
# Plot the fourth row of p.F2.D
par(new = TRUE)
plot(p.D.opF2, p.F2.D[4, ], xlab = "False Detection Rate", ylab = "Probability of Having the Flu Given Detection", col = "orange", axes = F)
# Add a legend to the graph
legend(x = "topright", legend = c("0.2 Disease Prevalence Rate", "0.4 Disease Prevalence Rate", "0.6 Disease Prevalence Rate", "0.8 Disease Prevalence Rate"), col = c("red", "blue", "green", "orange"), pch = 1)
```
## 4.
The dashed line represents a 0.5 probability of having the flu given detection. Any above this line would suggest a testing protocol that is more accurate than not. Overall the figure suggests that the probability of having swine flu given detection lowers as the false detection rate rises; thus, ideal tests have the lowest false detection rate and thus yield the highest probability of detecting true positives. A lower prevalence rate exacerbates the effects of the false detection rate; notice how the downwards curve of the matrix rows increases as the prevalence rate lowers, thus creating an illustration that would suggest the test with a 0.3 false detection rate when disease prevalcne is 0.8 would still be roughly as accurate as a test with a 0.2 false detection rate when disease prevalence is 0.2.

### Problem 2
```{r}
# Read in the data
d1 <- read.csv(file="http://faraway.neu.edu/biostats/assn1_dataset1.csv")
str(d1)
```

## 1. 
Null hypothesis: There is no association between age and swine flu prevalence.
Alternate hypothesis: There is an association between age and swine flu prevalence, specifically in the young adult age demographic.

## 2. 
```{r}
# Create 2-row x 1-column figure
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))

## Create panel 1 -> age distribution of swine patients
swine.data <- subset(d1, flu == "swine", select = age)
hist(swine.data$age, col = adjustcolor("red1"), xlim = c(0, 90), xlab = "Age", main = "Age Breakdown of Patients with Swine Flu", breaks = 30)

## Create panel 2 -> age distribution of seasonal patients
seasonal.data <- subset(d1, flu == "seasonal", select = age)
hist(seasonal.data$age, col = adjustcolor("red1"), xlim = c(0, 90), xlab = "Age", main = "Age Breakdown of Patients with Seasonal Flu", breaks = 30)
```

## 3.
The histogram distributions tell us that the swine flue targets individuals around the 18-65 age group, with most of this distribution being in the center. On the other hand, the seasonal flu only targets individuals ages below 18 and above 65. Notwithstanding minimal overlap between these age distributions, it appears that the two diseases do not target the same age demographics.

## 4.
```{r}
# Aggregate counts of swine data for the 18-65 age group
middle.subset <- subset(d1, age > 18, age < 65)
aggregate.middle.data <- aggregate(age ~ flu, data = middle.subset, FUN = length)
aggregate.middle.data

# Aggregate counts of seasonal data for the <18 and >65 age group
outer.subset <- subset(d1, age < 18 | age > 65)
aggregate.outer.data <- aggregate(age ~ flu, data = outer.subset, FUN = length)
aggregate.outer.data

#combine aggregates into a single data frame
aggregate.total <- data.frame(aggregate.middle.data$age, aggregate.outer.data$age)
# Add names to rows and columns in data frame
x <- c("Adults", "Children/Elderly")
colnames(aggregate.total) <- x
y <- c("Seasonal Flu", "Swine Flu")
rownames(aggregate.total) <- y
aggregate.total
```

## 5.
```{r}
chisq.test(aggregate.total)
```
The p-value is <2.2e-16; thus, we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis. There is a definitive link between age and swine flu prevalence, specifically that young adults are the most at-risk for contracting the new swine strain.
