### Jared's ENVR 2501 Repository
Contained in this repo are all the files of code I turned into Canvas during my time in ENVR 2501 at Northeastern University. Due to the learning environment in which these files were created, the code is predominantly written for readability and comprehension over efficiency.

Note that all code was written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using [RStudio Desktop 2021.09.2+382](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
