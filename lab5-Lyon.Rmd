```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Download the data
d1 <- read.csv("http://faraway.neu.edu/biostats/lab5_dataset1.csv")
d1
```

# Task 1
## 1.
H0: There is no statistically significant difference between the mortality means of the control pests and the treated pests.
HA: There is a statistically significant difference between the mortality means of the control pests and the treated pests.

## 2.
```{r}
hist(d1$mortality, col = adjustcolor("red1"), xlab = "Mortality", main = "Mortality Breakdown of Pests", breaks = 30)
```
The data is not normally distributed; it is skewed left. Thus, a log10 transformation is needed.

## 3.
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(d1$mortality, col = adjustcolor("red1"), xlab = "Mortality", main = "Mortality Breakdown of Pests", breaks = 30)
hist(log10(d1$mortality), col = adjustcolor("red1"), xlab = "Mortality", main = "Translated Mortality Breakdown of Pests", breaks = 30)
```
Use the transformed data because it is normally distributed.

## 4.
```{r}
mortality.aov <- aov(log10(mortality) ~ treatment, data = d1)
summary(mortality.aov)
```

## 5.
The ANOVA table shows a significance level of '***', indicating a statistically significant difference in morality across the treatment groups.

## 6.
A t-test can, at most, only analyze two groups at a time; since 5 group means are in need of analyzation, a t-test cannot be used.

## 7.
```{r}
mortality.tukey <- TukeyHSD(mortality.aov)
mortality.tukey
```

## 8.
```{r}
plot(mortality.tukey)
```

## 9.
```{r}
# Install multcompView & MASS packages
install.packages("multcompView")
require(multcompView)
install.packages("MASS")
```

## 10.
```{r}
labels <- multcompLetters(mortality.tukey$treatment[, "p adj"])$Letters
labels
```

## 11.
```{r}
# Compute means
means <- aggregate(mortality ~ treatment, mean, data = d1)
means
# Compute standard errors
stderrs <- aggregate(mortality ~ treatment, FUN = function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)), data = d1)
stderrs
# Create barplot figure
bp <- barplot(means$mortality, names = means$treatment, ylab = "Mean mortality of pest", ylim = c(0, 20))
# Add standard error bars
arrows(x0 = bp, y0 = means$mortality - stderrs$mortality, y1 = means$mortality + stderrs$mortality, code = 3, angle = 90, length = 0.1)
box()
# Add text labels
text(x = bp, y = means$mortality + stderrs$mortalit + 1, labels = labels)
```

## 12.
Treatments 2 and 4 seem to be the most effective in increading pest mortality, with both have similar mortality means and errors just under 15%.

# Task 2
```{r}
# Download the data
d2 <- read.csv("http://faraway.neu.edu/biostats/lab5_dataset2.csv")
str(d2)
hist(d2$mortality, col = adjustcolor("red1"), xlab = "Mortality", main = "Mortality Breakdown of Pests", breaks = 30)
```

## 1.
```{r}
mortality.aov.2 <- aov(log10(mortality) ~ treatment, data = d2)
summary(mortality.aov.2)
```
This ANOVA suggests a difference across the mortality means of the treatments.

## 2.
```{r}
mortality.tukey.2 <- TukeyHSD(mortality.aov.2)
mortality.tukey.2
plot(mortality.tukey.2)
```

## 3.
```{r}
labels.2 <- multcompLetters(mortality.tukey.2$treatment[, "p adj"])$Letters
labels.2

# Compute means
means.2 <- aggregate(mortality ~ treatment, mean, data = d2)
means.2
# Compute standard errors
stderrs.2 <- aggregate(mortality ~ treatment, FUN = function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x)), data = d2)
stderrs.2
# Create barplot figure
bp.2 <- barplot(means.2$mortality, names = means.2$treatment, ylab = "Mean mortality of pest", ylim = c(0, 20))
# Add standard error bars
arrows(x0 = bp.2, y0 = means.2$mortality - stderrs.2$mortality, y1 = means.2$mortality + stderrs.2$mortality, code = 3, angle = 90, length = 0.1)
box()
# Add text labels
text(x = bp, y = means.2$mortality + stderrs.2$mortalit + 1, labels = labels.2)
```

## 4.
Treatments 3 and 4 had the lowest mortaliy rates, with treatment 4 just barely being lower than treatment 3. Their rates hover just under 5%.

## 5.
We recommend treatment 4, as it has the highest mortality for pests whilst maintaining the lowest mortality for natural predators.
